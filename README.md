###### Open Source ECU Tuning and Diagnostics

The goal of ecutools is to provide an open source alternative to commercial J2534 pass-through devices and their accompanying PC software.

The project is broken down into 3 sub-projects. They are:

1. pass-through - J2534 compliant pass-through device and accompanying ecutools.io client software
2. server       - WebSocket server responsible for hosting real-time tuning / diagnostic sessions on ecutools.io
3. webui        - Real-time web based user interface for administration, configuration, and management of the ECU, pass-through device, and ecutools.io settings
