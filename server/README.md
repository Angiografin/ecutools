###### Open Source ECU Tuning and Diagnostics

The goal of ecutools server is to provde a real-time centralized hub to carry out one or more "tuning sessions". 

The server communicates with pass-through device and web browser clients using HTML WebSockets (RFC 6455) and a JSON based sub-protocol which is still under development.
